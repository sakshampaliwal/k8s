# RBAC

Role-Based Access Control enforces constraints that limit the actions available to specific users. RBAC (short for Role-Based Access Control) is a method of limiting access to computer systems by assigning granular roles to users. Each role represents a set of actions the user is allowed to perform—such as creating Kubernetes Pods but not deleting them. 

You could create roles such as Developer, Manager, and Security Team, each of which provides different permissions. Developer might have relatively restricted permissions, while Manager receives a broader range because of the increased oversight required by those individuals.

RBAC is technically an optional Kubernetes feature, although it’s enabled by default in popular distributions. You can check whether it’s available by running the `kubectl api-versions` command—if the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io` API exists, then you’re ready to use RBAC:

`$ kubectl api-versions | grep rbac
rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1`

To manually enable RBAC support, you must start the Kubernetes API server with the `--authorization-mode=RBAC` flag set:

`$ kube-apiserver --authorization-mode=RBAC`

You should refer to your distribution’s documentation for instructions on how to configure API server startup flags.

Historically, Kubernetes enabled authorization via attribute-based access control (ABAC). However, RBAC is now preferred over ABAC, which is difficult to manage and understand. [ABAC is considered deprecated in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/04/rbac-support-in-kubernetes/#:~:text=At%20this%20point%2C%20RBAC%20is,attention%20is%20focused%20on%20RBAC.) and users are encouraged to use RBAC authorization.

The Kubernetes API server has [built-in RBAC support](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac) that works with both [Users](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#users-in-kubernetes) and [Service Accounts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/service-accounts). RBAC is configured in your cluster by enabling the RBAC feature, then creating objects using the resources provided by the `rbac.authorization.k8s.io` API. There are four of these objects available:

- **Role:** A Role is a collection of permissions that allow users to perform specific actions (verbs, such as “get”, “create”, “and “delete”) on a defined set of Kubernetes resource types (such as Pods, Deployments, and Namespaces). Roles are namespaced objects; the permissions they grant only apply within the namespace that the Role belongs to.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: development
  name: pod-creator-viewer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "create"]
```

- **RoleBinding:** RoleBindings represent the links between your Roles and Users or Service Accounts. A RoleBinding lets you reference a Role, then grant those permissions to one or more users (termed Subjects).

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: dev-user-binding
  namespace: development
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: dev-user
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: User
  name: another-dev
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-creator-viewer
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

```

- **ClusterRole:** ClusterRoles work similarly to Roles but are a non-namespaced alternative for cluster-level resources. You’ll need to use a ClusterRole to control access to objects such as Nodes, which don’t belong to any namespace. ClusterRoles also allow you to globally access namespaced resources across all namespaces, such as every Pod in your cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: pod-viewer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get"]

```

- **ClusterRoleBinding:** ClusterRoleBinding is equivalent to RoleBinding, but targets ClusterRole resources instead of Roles.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: admin-user-binding
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: admin-user
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
- kind: User
  name: another-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: pod-viewer
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Users: 

- Users represent human individuals who interact with the Kubernetes cluster. For example, a developer or an admin.
- **Authentication:** Users authenticate using external services. This can include:
    - **Private Keys:** A common method where a user uses SSH keys to authenticate.
    - **Username and Passwords:** A simple method, but less secure.
    - **OAuth Services:** Integration with external providers like Google Accounts or GitHub for authentication.

Service Account:
Service Accounts are special accounts designed for applications and system components that run inside your Kubernetes cluster. They are not tied to human users but are intended for workloads (like Pods).
Service Accounts are useful for granting permissions to applications that need to interact with the Kubernetes API. For example, a Pod that needs to access certain resources in the cluster.
Service Accounts are Kubernetes objects, so you can create, modify, and delete them using `kubectl`. They can be assigned permissions through RoleBindings or ClusterRoleBindings.

Kubernetes uses service accounts to authenticate and authorize requests by pods to the Kubernetes API server. Kubernetes automatically assigns newly created pods to the “default” service account in your cluster and all applications share this service account. However, this configuration may not be desirable if, for example, you are using some applications for development purposes, and want those applications to use a “dev” service account instead of a default one.

Just as we configured roles per user type, you can create service accounts that reflect application type in order to streamline management.

### Steps to Create and Use a Custom Service Account in Kubernetes

1. **Create a Custom Service Account**:
First, define your custom service account in a YAML file or directly using a `kubectl` command. Here's an example YAML:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: dev
    ```
    
    Apply it using:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f dev-service-account.yaml
    ```
    
2. **Disable Default Token Auto-Mounting (Optional)**:
If you want to prevent the automatic mounting of the service account token in your pods, set `automountServiceAccountToken: false` in your service account definition:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: dev
    automountServiceAccountToken: false
    ```
    
3. **Specify the Service Account in Pod Configuration**:
In your pod’s YAML definition, reference the custom service account using the `serviceAccountName` field:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-app
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: dev
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image
    ```
    
4. **Deploy Your Pod**:
Apply the pod configuration to create the pod with the specified service account:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f my-app-pod.yaml
    ```
