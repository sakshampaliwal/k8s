# CRD

CRD is a way to create your own, custom resources in Kubernetes. A Custom Resource Definition enables you to define a new kind of resource, such as `VPCs`, `Firewalls`, or even `TodoLists`, that Kubernetes doesn't offer out of the box. This new resource can then be used to manage your application's specific needs, making Kubernetes even more flexible and powerful.

Each CRD you create gets its own API endpoints that you can use to query, create, and edit instances of that resource. Custom resources are fully supported within kubectl, so you can run commands like `kubectl get backgroundjobs` to interact with your application's objects.

There are two things CRD and CR, I will explain you with example lets say you define deployment resource in kubernetes cluster and when you types something wrong in it or may be syntax or write something that is not part of deployment then it arises error why? because it first validates it with resource definition that is present by default in same way CRD(Custom Resource Definition) is our validator if CR is correct or not. and CR is Custom Resource.

Custom Resource Controller watches the Custom Resource for any changes.

Custom Controller are made usually in golang.
