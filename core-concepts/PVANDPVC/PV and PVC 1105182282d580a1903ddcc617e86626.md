# PV and PVC

A persistent volume (PV) is a piece of storage in the Kubernetes cluster, while a persistent volume claim (PVC) is a request for storage.

There are two ways to use persistent storage in Kubernetes:

- Use an existing persistent volume
- Dynamically provision new persistent volumes

To use an existing PV, your application will need to use a PVC that is bound to a PV, and the PV should include the minimum resources that the PVC requires.

For dynamic storage provisioning, your application will need to use a PVC that is bound to a storage class. The storage class contains the authorization to provision new persistent volumes.

One of the key benefits of using Persistent Volumes is their ability to decouple storage from individual pods. This decoupling allows for greater flexibility in managing pods, as the data stored in a Persistent Volume remains intact even if a pod is deleted or rescheduled. Additionally, Persistent Volumes support various access modes, allowing multiple pods to read and write data simultaneously.

PVCs do not specify a specific PVâ€”instead, they specify which StorageClass the pod requires. Administrators can define StorageClasses that indicate properties of storage devices, such as performance, service levels, and back-end policies.A major advantage of the PVC pattern in Kubernetes is that it allows developers to dynamically request storage resources, without being aware of the implementation of underlying storage devices.
