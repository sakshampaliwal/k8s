# Deployment

In Kubernetes, a deployment is an object that manages a set of identical pods. It provides a way to declaratively define and manage the desired state of a set of replica pods, which allows for easy scaling, updating, and rolling back of deployments.

A deployment ensures that a specified number of replicas of a pod are running at all times, and it also provides functionality for updating and rolling back deployments. When a deployment is updated, Kubernetes will create a new set of pods with the updated configuration and then gradually replace the old pods with the new ones, ensuring that the deployment remains available throughout the update process.

The main parts of a Kubernetes deployment YAML file are:

1. **`apiVersion`**: This field specifies the API version that the YAML file is using. For example, **`apps/v1`** for the **`apps`** API version.
2. **`kind`**: This field specifies the type of Kubernetes object that is being defined. For a deployment, the value should be **`Deployment`**.
3. **`metadata`**: This section contains metadata about the deployment, such as its name and labels.
4. **`spec`**: This section contains the desired state of the deployment, including the number of replicas, the container image, and the ports that should be exposed.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-image:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          env:
            - name: DB_HOST
              value: db.example.com
            - name: DB_PORT
              value: "5432"
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: "64Mi"
              cpu: "250m"
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
```

Here is an explanation of the different sections and fields in this YAML file:

- **`apiVersion`**: This field specifies the Kubernetes API version that this YAML file is using. In this example, we are using the **`apps/v1`** API version.
- **`kind`**: This field specifies the type of Kubernetes resource that we are creating. In this case, we are creating a **`Deployment`**.
- **`metadata`**: This field contains metadata about the deployment, including its name and labels.
- **`spec`**: This field specifies the desired state of the deployment.
    - **`replicas`**: This field specifies the desired number of replicas (i.e., instances) of the application. In this example, we want to create 3 replicas.
    - **`selector`**: This field specifies how the deployment should select which pods to manage. In this example, we are using the **`matchLabels`** selector to match pods with the **`app: my-app`** label.
    - **`template`**: This field specifies the pod template that the deployment should use to create new pods.
        - **`metadata`**: This field contains metadata about the pod, including its labels.
        - **`spec`**: This field specifies the desired state of the pod.
            - **`containers`**: This field specifies the containers that should be run in the pod.
                - **`name`**: This field specifies the name of the container.
                - **`image`**: This field specifies the Docker image to use for the container.
                - **`ports`**: This field specifies the ports that should be exposed by the container.
                - **`env`**: This field specifies environment variables that should be set in the container.
                - **`resources`**: This field specifies the resource requests and limits for the container.
                    - **`requests`**: This field specifies the minimum amount of resources that the container needs.
                    - **`limits`**: This field specifies the maximum amount of resources that the container can use.
    
    Selector: A selector is used to identify which pods a service should target. When you create a service in Kubernetes, you can specify a selector that matches the labels of the pods you want the service to target. Labels are key-value pairs that are attached to Kubernetes objects, such as pods, services, and deployments. For example, you might add a **`app=webserver`** label to all the pods that are running your web server application. When you create a service for your web server, you can use a selector to target all the pods that have the **`app=webserver`** label.
    
    - **Some basic commands used here:**
        
        1. **`kubectl apply`**: Applies the configuration changes defined in a YAML file to the Kubernetes cluster.
        
        ```yaml
        kubectl apply -f <path/to/yaml/file>
        ```
        
        2. **`kubectl get`**: Retrieves information about Kubernetes resources, including deployments.
        
        ```yaml
        kubectl get <resource_type>
        ```
        
        3. **`kubectl describe`**: Provides detailed information about a Kubernetes resource.
        
        ```yaml
        kubectl describe <resource_type> <resource_name>
        ```
        
        4. **`kubectl scale`**: Changes the number of replicas in a deployment.
        
        ```yaml
        kubectl scale deployment/<deployment_name> --replicas=<number_of_replicas>
        ```
        
        5. **`kubectl rollout`**: Manages the deployment of new versions of your application.
        
        ```yaml
        kubectl rollout status deployment/<deployment_name>
        kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment_name>
        kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment_name>
        ```
        
        6. **`kubectl delete`**: Deletes a Kubernetes resource, including deployments.
        
        ```yaml
        kubectl delete <resource_type> <resource_name>
        ```
