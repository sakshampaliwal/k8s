# Core Concepts

This folder provides an in-depth look at the foundational concepts in Kubernetes. It covers the essential building blocks that you'll use to deploy and manage applications in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Topics Covered:
- **Pods**: The smallest and simplest Kubernetes object, representing a single running process.
- **Services**: Expose a set of Pods as a network service and allow communication between different parts of your application.
- **Deployments**: A controller that manages the creation and scaling of Pods, ensuring the desired number of replicas are running.
- **StatefulSets**: Used for managing stateful applications, ensuring ordered deployment and scaling.
- **ReplicaSets**: Ensures that a specified number of identical Pods are running at any given time.
- **DaemonSets**: Ensures that a Pod is running on all (or some) nodes in the cluster.

## Learning Objectives:
- Gain an understanding of the core Kubernetes objects and their usage.
- Learn how to define and manage applications using these core objects.
