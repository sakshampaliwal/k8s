# Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
```

And here is an explanation of the different sections and fields in this YAML file:

- **`apiVersion`**: This field specifies the Kubernetes API version that this YAML file is using. In this example, we are using the **`v1`** API version.
- **`kind`**: This field specifies the type of Kubernetes resource that we are creating. In this case, we are creating a **`Service`**.
- **`metadata`**: This field contains metadata about the service, including its name.
- **`spec`**: This field specifies the desired state of the service.
    - **`selector`**: This field specifies how the service should select which pods to route traffic to. In this example, we are using the **`app: my-app`** selector to match pods with the **`app: my-app`** label.
    - **`ports`**: This field specifies the ports that the service should listen on.
        - **`name`**: This field specifies the name of the port.
        - **`protocol`**: This field specifies the protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP) that the port uses.
        - **`port`**: This field specifies the port number that the service should listen on.
        - **`targetPort`**: This field specifies the port number that the pods are listening on.
    - **`type`**: This field specifies the type of service. There are four types of services in Kubernetes:
        - **`ClusterIP`**: This is the default type of service. It creates a virtual IP address that can be used to access the pods in the service from within the cluster.
        - **`NodePort`**: This type of service exposes the pods to the outside world by mapping a port on each node to the service port.
        - **`LoadBalancer`**: This type of service creates an external load balancer that routes traffic to the pods.
        - **`ExternalName`**: This type of service maps the service to a DNS name.

In this example, we are using the **`ClusterIP`** type of service. This means that the service will create a virtual IP address that can be used to access the pods in the service from within the cluster. The service will listen on port 80 and route traffic to the pods on port 8080.
