# Traffic mgmt in ingress

### Overview of Ingress Architecture

1. **Ingress Resource**: This is a Kubernetes API object that defines how external HTTP/S traffic should be routed to services within the cluster. It contains rules that map URLs to services.
2. **Ingress Controller**: This is a component (usually running as Pods) that processes Ingress resources and manages the routing of incoming traffic based on the defined rules. Different controllers have different implementations (e.g., NGINX, Traefik, HAProxy).
3. **Kubernetes Services**: Services act as stable endpoints for your Pods. They abstract away the complexities of Pods that might be created or destroyed. The Ingress controller routes traffic to these Services based on the rules defined in the Ingress resource.

### Step-by-Step Explanation of Traffic Management

### 1. **User Sends a Request**

When a user (client) makes a request to your application, the request typically comes in through a public IP address or a domain name pointing to the cluster. Here’s how it works:

- **Public IP/Domain**: This is associated with a LoadBalancer or NodePort service that exposes the Ingress controller to the outside world.

### 2. **Ingress Controller Receives the Traffic**

The request first hits the **Ingress controller**, which is listening for incoming traffic. The controller is usually exposed via a **LoadBalancer** service in cloud environments or a **NodePort** service in on-prem setups.

- **LoadBalancer Service**: In cloud environments, this service provisions an external load balancer that routes traffic to the Ingress controller Pods.
- **NodePort Service**: In on-prem setups, the service opens a specific port on each worker node. Traffic hitting that port on any worker node is routed to the Ingress controller Pods.

### 3. **Ingress Controller Processes the Request**

The Ingress controller examines the incoming request's URL and host header. It uses the rules defined in the Ingress resource to determine how to route the request:

- **Path Matching**: The controller checks the request's path against the defined rules in the Ingress resource. For example, if the path is `/api`, the controller will route it to the service defined for `/api`.
- **Host Matching**: If the Ingress resource specifies hostnames, the controller checks if the request's host header matches any of the defined hosts. For example, `example.com` can route to different services based on the path.

### 4. **Routing to the Correct Service**

Once the Ingress controller determines which service should handle the request, it forwards the request to the appropriate **Kubernetes Service**. The service, in turn, manages routing to the underlying Pods that implement the application logic:

- **Load Balancing**: The Service automatically load balances requests to all healthy Pods associated with it. Kubernetes uses a round-robin or session-affinity mechanism to distribute traffic.

### 5. **Service Routes to Pods**

The Service forwards the request to one of its associated Pods. Here's how it works:

- Each Service in Kubernetes is assigned a stable IP address (ClusterIP), and it can be accessed using its name (DNS).
- The Service routes the request to one of the Pods based on the load-balancing strategy.

### 6. **Response Flow Back to the Client**

Once the Pods process the request, they generate a response and send it back through the same path:

- **Pod to Service**: The response goes back to the Service.
- **Service to Ingress Controller**: The Service forwards the response to the Ingress controller.
- **Ingress Controller to Client**: Finally, the Ingress controller sends the response back to the client.

### Key Points About Ingress and Ingress Controllers

- **Scalability**: Ingress controllers can be scaled horizontally. If traffic increases, you can add more replicas of the Ingress controller to handle the load.
- **Load Balancing**: The Ingress controller itself can be a single instance, but it can also be deployed as multiple replicas for redundancy and load balancing.
- **Health Checks**: Most Ingress controllers perform health checks on the services they route to, ensuring that traffic is only sent to healthy Pods.
- **SSL Termination**: Many Ingress controllers can manage SSL certificates, terminating SSL/TLS connections and forwarding decrypted traffic to services over HTTP.

### Example of How Traffic Flows with Ingress

Let’s break down the flow with a practical example:

1. **Ingress Resource Definition**:
Here’s an example Ingress resource:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: example-ingress
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - path: /api
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: api-service
                port:
                  number: 8080
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: frontend-service
                port:
                  number: 80
    
    ```
    
2. **Traffic Flow**:
    - **User**: A user navigates to `http://example.com/api`.
    - **Ingress Controller**: The Ingress controller receives the request.
    - **Routing Logic**: The controller checks the Ingress rules and finds that requests to `/api` should go to `api-service`.
    - **Service Forwarding**: The Ingress controller forwards the request to `api-service` on port `8080`.
    - **Pod Handling**: The `api-service` load balances the request to one of its associated Pods, which processes it.
    - **Response**: The response from the Pod goes back through the Service, the Ingress controller, and finally to the user.

Yes, you typically need to create a **Service** to expose the **Ingress controller** in your Kubernetes cluster. The Ingress controller is deployed as a set of Pods that handle the routing of external traffic to your services. To make these Pods accessible from outside the cluster, they need to be exposed via a Kubernetes Service.

In cloud environments (like AWS, GCP, Azure), you can use a `LoadBalancer` type service.
In on-prem or bare-metal setups, you might use a `NodePort` type service.
