# Kubernetes Notes Repository

This repository contains my personal notes and references on Kubernetes. It serves as a collection of everything I've learned, researched, and experimented with regarding Kubernetes. These notes are intended for my own use as a reference to help with learning and managing Kubernetes.

The structure of this repository will evolve as I continue to explore Kubernetes, and it will cover various topics, concepts, and best practices that I find valuable.

Feel free to browse and use it for your own reference as well!
