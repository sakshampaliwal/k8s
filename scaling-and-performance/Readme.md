# Scaling and Performance

This folder focuses on strategies and techniques for scaling your Kubernetes applications and optimizing the performance of your clusters.

## Topics Covered:
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)**: Automatically adjusts the number of Pods in a Deployment or ReplicaSet based on CPU utilization or custom metrics.
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)**: Automatically adjusts CPU and memory resource requests for Pods.
- **Cluster Autoscaler**: Automatically adjusts the size of your Kubernetes cluster by adding or removing nodes based on resource usage.
- **Load Balancing**: Best practices and techniques for balancing traffic across multiple Pods or services.
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimizing the performance of Pods, containers, and the Kubernetes control plane by adjusting resource limits, CPU/memory allocations, and more.

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand how to scale applications in Kubernetes dynamically.
- Learn techniques to optimize the performance of your workloads and cluster infrastructure.
