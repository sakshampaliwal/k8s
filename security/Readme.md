# Security

Security is a critical aspect of Kubernetes. This folder covers Kubernetes security best practices, including securing clusters, managing access, and securing sensitive data.

## Topics Covered:
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Control access to the Kubernetes API by assigning roles to users and services.
- **Pod Security Policies (PSP)**: Define security settings for Pods to ensure they meet your security standards.
- **Secrets Management**: Safely store and manage sensitive data like passwords, API tokens, and SSH keys.
- **Network Policies**: Define rules that control the communication between Pods, namespaces, and services.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scanning container images for vulnerabilities and applying security patches to prevent attacks.

## Learning Objectives:
- Learn how to secure Kubernetes clusters and workloads using RBAC, PSP, and other security features.
- Understand how to manage sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to resources in your Kubernetes environment.
