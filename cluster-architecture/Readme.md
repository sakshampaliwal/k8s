# Cluster Architecture

This folder contains notes and documentation about the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster. It provides an overview of the key components, their interactions, and how Kubernetes manages resources across a cluster.

## Topics Covered:
- **Master Node**: Understand the control plane components such as the API Server, Controller Manager, and Scheduler.
- **Worker Node**: Learn about the components on the worker nodes, including the kubelet and kube-proxy.
- **etcd**: The distributed key-value store used by Kubernetes to store all cluster data.
- **Scheduler**: Understand how Kubernetes places Pods on nodes based on resource requirements.
- **Controller Manager**: Learn about controllers like ReplicaSets, Deployments, and StatefulSets that ensure the desired state of your cluster.

## Learning Objectives:
- Understand how Kubernetes components interact within the cluster.
- Get familiar with how Kubernetes maintains the desired state of applications and services.
